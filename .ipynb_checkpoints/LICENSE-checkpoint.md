MB TYPE FONT LICENSE
1. We, the authors listed in README, own the code
delivered with this license. Below, these are called our code. The person or entity who downloaded this license is
the license downloader. The humans designated by the license
downloader to use our code are the licensed users.
2. This license is non-exclusive and non-transferable. It
takes effect when the fonts are delivered to the license
downloader. I reserve all rights not granted below.
3. Licensed users can be employees or human contractors
of the license downloader. If the license downloader is human, the
license downloader themselves can be a licensed user, as can
immediate family members (e.g., spouse, parent, child,
sibling) of the license downloader. Others—cousins, classmates, corporate entities, internet randos—cannot be
designated as licensed users.
4. The maximum number of licensed users is determined
by whatever size license was downloaded by the license
downloader. The license downloader can change who’s designated
as a licensed user, as long as the total doesn’t exceed
this maximum.
5. Subject to the limitations below, licensed users can
install our code on any computing devices, or any
accounts on multi-user computing devices, dedicated
exclusively to them. Licensed users can use our code in
any way they like, including printed documents, logos,
and commercial products.
6. Licensed users who are employees or contractors of
the license downloader can use our code only for projects on
behalf of the license downloader. Likewise, anyone who regularly uses our code for projects on behalf of the license
downloader needs to be a licensed user.
7. Copies of our code cannot be distributed to anyone
who is not a licensed user. Nor can our code be stored
in a location accessible to those who are not licensed
users (e.g., a fle server or source repository).
8. There are three exceptions to ¶ 7. First: read-only copies
of our code can be embedded in digital fles, including
PDFs, e-books, and software apps. Read-only means
that those who use these digital fles can neither install
our code nor use them to make new documents. Second: the webfonts (= WOFF2 fles) can be used on up
to three websites owned by the license downloader. Third:
read–write copies of our code can be embedded in
word-processing documents that will be shared with
fewer than 20 people.
9. These embedding rights don’t extend to digital fles
that the license downloader creates on behalf of those who
are not licensed users (e.g., your clients, if you are a
designer or developer). They need a separate license.
This limitation doesn’t apply to documents made by a
law offce for its clients (e.g., letters and court flings),
nor documents made by judges or other court employees for court business (e.g., opinions and orders).
10. Licensed users can modify our code, including converting them to other formats. Our copyright and trademark
notices must remain intact. Modifed fonts can be
shared with other licensed users. The same license
terms apply to the modifed fonts. No technical support
is available for modifed fonts.
11. This license remains in effect until terminated.
12. The license downloader can terminate this license by sending
me a written request along with confrmation that all
copies of our code, including embedded copies, have
been deleted. If this request is made within 30 days of
the license order, I’ll refund the license fee.
13. If the license downloader or any licensed user breaches this
license, it will automatically terminate.
14. If the license downloader or any licensed user has unusual or
excessive technical-support needs, I can terminate the
license by refunding the license fee.
15. None of our descriptions of our code are legal advice.
16. California law governs this license. Courts in Los Angeles County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over
claims arising under this license. The license downloader
agrees to service of process at the email address on the
original order.
17. IMPORTANT! Our code are offered on an as-is basis.
The license downloader assumes the entire risk of the quality and performance of our code, and waives both the
implied warranty of ftness and the implied warranty
against infringement of third-party rights.
18. ALSO IMPORTANT! Our liability for costs, damages,
or other losses arising from use of our code under this
license—including third-party claims—is limited to a
refund of the license fee.
19. This is the whole license. If part of the license turns out
to be unenforceable, the rest will remain. This license
can be changed only if the license downloader & I agree in
writing (including email).
